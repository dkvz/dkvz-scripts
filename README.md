# Some scripts I started gathering

# Environment variables I use
Should be set in bashrc or default values will apply (use `export VARIABLE_NAME=value`).

* DELETEME_FILE - Path to the throwable notepad text file (see n.sh)

# TODO for install script
- Create links to scripts that have ".sh" and remove the .sh in the link name.

# TODO
- [x] IP location script: add a lookup in the ASN DB -> Done but that info seems completely worthless.
